# FYP-Arnau-Bonet-2022

This is the repo for the FYP of Arnau Bonet Farrés: Financial News Classification Model for NLP-based Portfolio Construction.



This is the code to classify articles into categories and send them to their relevant folders. This code is only for Marketwatch, but the same is used for The Motley Fool and for Reuters, I just used this one as an example.

This is the portfolio construction algorithm that I have used. In this case, it's for the benchmark portfolio using unclassified news. For the categorised portfolios it's essentially the same but using the categorised news.
