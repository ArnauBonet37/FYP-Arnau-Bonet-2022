690;26/07/2018;BP buying BHP's U.S. assets for $10.5 billion;"BP buying BHP's U.S. assets for $10.5 billion. SYDNEY -- BP PLC will buy the bulk of BHP Billiton Ltd.'s U.S. onshore oil-and-gas unit for US$10.5 billion, as the U.K. oil major rebuilds in the U.S. after the Deepwater Horizon disaster and BHP exits a business it has called a costly and mistimed investment.The sale accelerates a reshuffling of assets among global energy companies as oil prices surge to levels not seen since 2014. Chesapeake Energy Corp. said Thursday it is selling oil and gas fields in Ohio for $2 billion, while Royal Dutch Shell PLC has nearly completed a $30 billion asset-sale program begun after its roughly $50 billion acquisition of BG Group in 2016.The deal is an important milestone for BP, which is in the middle of an ambitious growth plan. The company is on track to stage an impressive comeback after years of retrenchment following its fatal blowout in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.The acquisition will grant the British oil giant access to some of the hottest acreage in the U.S. shale patch. Big oil companies have historically focused more on giant offshore projects, but they are increasingly sinking money into shale developments that start producing and throwing off cash faster.In a second deal, BHP said it would sell its Fayetteville shale business in Arkansas to closely held Merit Energy Co., in an agreement worth $300 million.""The sale of our onshore U.S. assets is consistent with our long-term plan to continue to simplify and strengthen our portfolio to generate shareholder value and returns for decades to come,"" said BHP Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie. The world's biggest miner by market value said it intends to return the sale proceeds to shareholders, because net debt is at the lower end of a target range.BHP said both deals need to be approved by regulators. It expects to complete them by the end of October, but that the right to economic profits would transfer from July 1.After months of pressure from activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. and other investors, BHP last August announced plans to exit businesses that included more than 838,000 acres in shale-rich U.S. regions. Elliott, which built up a stake of more than 5% in BHP's U.K.-listed shares, declined to comment on news of the shale sales.""Our priority with this transaction is to maximize value and returns to shareholders,"" Mr. Mackenzie said.A posttax impairment charge of about $2.8 billion against the carrying value of the U.S. assets will be booked for the 2018 fiscal year, said BHP.BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley described the deal as transformational for the company's shale business and a major step toward delivering on BP's growth strategy.While BP already has a sizable position onshore the U.S., its portfolio mostly comprises gas. BHP's assets will substantially boost the company's output of more valuable oil.The deal will add 190,000 barrels a day of oil and gas production and 4.6 billion barrels of discovered resources to BP's asset base, promising output growth into the next decade.In striking the deal, BP is attempting a delicate balancing act. Despite rising oil prices, investors have signaled they want companies to remain financially disciplined and reward shareholders that stuck with them through a dramatic industry slump in 2014.Alongside the acquisition, BP announced plans to raise its second quarter dividend by 2.5% -- the first such increase in 15 quarters. It has structured the deal with 50% of the payment deferred over six months after completion, funded through equity. The company said that will allow the acquisition to fit within its current spending budget and targets for gearing.Robb M.

941;13/01/2021;Qualcomm to Acquire Nuvia for About $1.4B;Qualcomm to Acquire Nuvia for About $1.4B. Barely two weeks into the new year, Qualcomm gave investors the latest sign that consolidation in the semiconductor industry is likely to continue well into 2021, by announcing its intent to acquire Nuvia for roughly $1.4 billion.Qualcomm shares (ticker: QCOM) rallied on the news and closed up 1.9% to $157.42 in Wednesday trading.Qualcomm’s reasoning for the acquisition isn’t immediately clear, but Barron’s is cautiously optimistic about the deal. The two-year-old Nuvia’s competitive advantage lies in its processor designs, which are largely based on technology developed by Arm Holdings. The company also boasts a talented roster of chip executives, who are credited with helping companies such as Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google develop chips for various needs.Nuvia has designed chips that are designed for cloud computing in a bid to challenge Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel (INTC). Nuvia raised $240 million in its second funding round in September, and planned to start testing its chips this year. These days, designing and making even a single line of the most advanced chips can cost hundreds of millions in research and development costs—which is potentially where Qualcomm comes in.Qualcomm dropped developing processors for the cloud two years ago, after a failed start. In the announcement, Qualcomm talked about Nuvia contributing to its mobile processor technology, especially in power efficiency, which Nuvia’s Arm-based processors are usually quite good at.“Nuvia [central processing units] are expected to be integrated across Qualcomm Technologies’ broad portfolio of products, powering flagship smartphones, next-generation laptops, and digital cockpits, as well as Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, extended reality and infrastructure networking solutions,” Qualcomm said in the announcement.Qualcomm’s Nuvia acquisition comes amid upheaval in the chip industry. In what would be the largest deal in the industry, Nvidia made a $40 billion bid for Arm in 2020, which is currently backed by SoftBank Group (9984.Japan). Arm is a slightly different kind of chip company, designing the blueprints for semiconductors and then licensing them to companies such as Qualcomm. Arm’s designs power most of the world’s smartphones.Last year, Advanced Micro Devices announced its plan to acquire Xilinx (XNLX) in an all-stock $35 billion deal. Analog Devices (ADI) agreed to acquire Maximum Integrated Products for $20 billion, and in the fall, Marvell Technology (MRVL) said it planned to buy optical networking component maker Inphi for $10 billion.Qualcomm stock has rallied over the past year, gaining more than 70% as the adoption of 5G mobile technology has rolled out across the world. The company has settled years of legal trouble, including a U.S. Federal Trade Commission antitrust case, and fended off an activist investor and hostile takeover bid.Write to Max A.

Polypore International Inc. agreed to sell itself to industrial conglomerate 3M Co. and Japan’s Asahi Kasei Corp. in a two-part deal that values the filtration company at about $2.7 billion.Including debt, the deal is valued at about $3.2 billion. Asahi Kasei AHKSY, -0.05% will buy Charlotte, N.C.-based Polypore’s US:PPO energy storage business for $2.2 billion, while 3M MMM, +1.10% will pay $1 billion for the company’s separations media business.Asahi Kasei, a Tokyo-based maker of fibers and textiles, said it would pay $60.50 a share, a 28.4% premium to the 30-day average of Polypore’s share price. Monday’s deal is the latest in a wave of acquisitions for Japanese companies over the past month despite the weaker yen.3M, meanwhile, will boost its purification business through the deal. 3M, which is best-known for products like Scotch tape and Post-it Notes, also has benefited from stronger sales of water-filtration products in China and other developing countries where pollution fears are growing in recent quarters. 3M said the purchase would broaden its array of technology used for filtering out very tiny particles in such fields as pharmaceuticals and water treatment.An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.;2

MMM, +1.10% said Tuesday it was partnering with engine maker Cummins Inc. CMI, +1.81% to boost production of high efficiency particulate filters used in its powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs). The maker of N9N facemasks, and other protective, construction and consumer products, said the partnership could more than double the current production of filters for PAPRs, which is needed as production of PAPRs have been ramped up to meet the surge in demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Cummins' facility in Neillsville, Wisconsin will use equipment normally used to make diesel engine filters to make the PAPR filters, as guided by a 3M design, with production expected to begin by the end of April. After the filters are made, they will be sent to 3M's plant in Valley, Nebraska where PAPRs are made. Shares of 3M rose 2.7% and Cummins gained 2.1%.

701;25/06/2018;Judge dismisses climate-change lawsuit against 5 oil giants;Judge dismisses climate-change lawsuit against 5 oil giants.

864;29/01/2021;Why Facebook is considering an antitrust lawsuit against Apple;Why Facebook is considering an antitrust lawsuit against Apple. Facebook Inc. and Apple Inc. are edging perilously close to all-out legal war, with the social-media giant strongly considering a lawsuit that could ultimately sway antitrust investigators.The conflagration centers on Apple’s AAPL, -0.01% new iOS 14 policy, due this spring. It includes new privacy features that will for the first time require apps to ask for users’ permission to track them around the web. Such a feature, Facebook FB, +0.00% claims, would severely limit online advertising and kill small businesses in the process.Tension between the companies has escalated for years to the point where Facebook is considering suing Apple for giving preferential treatment to its own apps while imposing restrictive rules on third-party apps from Facebook and others, according to reports. “As we have said repeatedly, we believe Apple is behaving anti-competitively by using their control of the App Store to benefit their bottom line at the expense of app developers and small businesses,” a Facebook spokeswoman said in a statement to MarketWatch. Apple had no comment.Facebook, which launched a series of print and digital ads in December to make its point, drilled home its animus during an earnings call with analysts on Wednesday.“We are also seeing Apple’s business depend more and more on gaining share in apps and services against us and other developers,” Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said during the call. “So Apple has every incentive to use their dominant platform position to interfere with how our apps and other apps work, which they regularly do to preference their own.”Apple CEO Tim Cook ratcheted the hostility Thursday without mentioning Facebook by name.“If a business is built on misleading users, on data exploitation, on choices that are not choices at all, then it does not deserve our praise. It deserves reform,” Cook said at the online-only Computers, Privacy and Data Protection conference on Thursday. “Too many are still asking the question, ‘How much can we get away with?’ when they need to be asking, ‘What are the consequences?’“What are the consequences of prioritizing conspiracy theories and violent incitement simply because of their high rates of engagement? What are the consequences of not just tolerating but rewarding content that undermines public trust in lifesaving vaccinations? What are the consequences of seeing thousands of users join extremist groups, and then perpetuating an algorithm that recommends even more?”The simmering conflict underscores contrasting business approaches: Apple slavishly harps on the philosophy of consumer privacy in which the customer pays for their internet experience. Facebook, by contrast, relies on data about its members to fuel its digital advertising business.Read more: Facebook and Apple Embody New Tech DivideIronically, a legal showdown between the tech titans could hurt them on the antitrust front, since both are under investigation for the very things they are accusing one another of, says Elizabeth Renieris, founding director of the Notre Dame-IBM Technology Ethics Lab at the University of Notre Dame.“What this feud demonstrates more than anything is that Facebook and Apple have tremendous gatekeeping powers over the market,” she told MarketWatch. “It demonstrates just how much Facebook controls access to customers or audiences through its ads ecosystem,” Renieris said. “At the same time, the dispute reveals how much power Apple has to mediate access to our personal data through its engineering choices and policy decisions.”;3
805;13/07/2021;China Regulatory Pressures, U.S. Tensions Create New Winners and Losers;China Regulatory Pressures, U.S. Tensions Create New Winners and Losers. Investors eyeing the uncertainty around Chinese stocks and U.S.-China tensions as a bargain-hunting opportunity may want to proceed carefully.The market’s focus has been on a spate of regulatory measures by Beijing in recent months, many of them aimed at its large domestic internet giants like Alibaba Group Holding (ticker: BABA), but the latest front on data security could ensnare more multinational companies operating in China. Add in measures trickling out from the Biden administration to address the evolving U.S.-China relationship, and investors have a lot to reassess.Analysts see a low bar for China’s regulatory scrutiny, which started rattling markets after Ant Group’s scuttled IPO last fall and has again rattled investors after Beijing launched a cybersecurity review of Didi Global (DIDI) days after it went public in the U.S. last month.The regulatory scrutiny had largely been about gaining political control over some of China’s Internet behemoths to mitigate financial risk—Ant, for example, was six times more levered than typical Chinese banks—and an antimonopoly push to improve the circumstances of gig workers and help small and medium enterprises that are using the big technology platforms that the likes of Alibaba, Baidu (BIDU), and Tencent Holdings (0700.Hong Kong) have dominated, said TS Lombard’s Rory Green in a webinar with clients.But last week brought a new front focused on data that may prove even harder for big tech companies to navigate—and could ensnare more global multinationals. Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA) have already run up against Beijing’s scrutiny around data—though they have been able to comply, in part because U.S. data regulations are still less formalized, according to Green. “Going forward, competing U.S.-China data agendas are going to be very hard to balance,” he says. “There are big risks for western companies expanding in China and those operating already.” China’s data-security law is very broad and nebulous, making it harder for companies, including China’s tech giants, to address and comply with. ByteDance, owner of TikTok, said it was shelving its plans to list offshore indefinitely as regulators told it to address data-security risks. So far this year, 37 Chinese companies have gone public in the U.S., with another 19 having filed, according to Dealogic. But the heightened scrutiny from Beijing over new overseas listings and the sharp declines in Didi ‘s shares after it went public in the U.S.—after Chinese regulators urged it not to, according to The Wall Street Journal—could stem the demand for U.S.-listed Chinese IPOs in the near term and keep Chinese companies closer to home. Another source of uncertainty: How the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board plan to enforce legislation that paves the way for delisting Chinese companies not in accordance with U.S. auditing rules. The comment period at the board ended earlier this week, and investors are now looking for details—including when the three-year window for compliance begins—and whether there is any hope for U.S. and China to reach some deal over the roughly 248 Chinese companies listed on U.S. exchanges.The uncertainty on multiple fronts poses a challenge for China’s big tech stocks in particular, and the MSCI China index, which is heavily skewed toward those companies, with Green recommending caution until there’s more clarity from Beijing, at least on the data-security side. Investors with a time horizon of five years or more, though, may see buying opportunities—as long as they have recalibrated their growth expectations so that they no longer assume monopoly-led returns and hyper growth like in the past. “More generally, this transition from all-out growth to more regulated growth tied to national objectives is going to lower valuations of the big technology companies,” Green says.In the interim, Green sees opportunity in smaller tech companies that benefit as larger rivals face regulatory pressures and hardware companies—think robotics, 5G infrastructure, semiconductors, and clean-energy vehicles—that benefit from being at the nexus of global economic trends and Beijing’s political objectives. While the iShares MSCI China exchange-traded fund (MCHI) is down 4% in the past three months, the iShares MSCI China Small-Cap ETF (ECNS) is up 6%.Write to Reshma Kapadia at reshma.kapadia@barrons.com;3
534;10/09/2021;Apple Stock Fell After Judge Issues a ‘Legal Blow’ Against App Store;Apple Stock Fell After Judge Issues a ‘Legal Blow’ Against App Store. A U.S. District Judge ruled Friday that Apple must allow developers to offer alternative payment systems in software sold through the company’s App Store. The decision in Apple’s high-profile legal battle with Fortnite maker Epic Games deals a blow to the lucrative App Store marketplace.Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers of the Northern District of California issued a permanent injunction that would force Apple to allow developers the option to include links to alternative payment methods in their apps. Apple’s own payment system, the lone option until now, took a 30% cut from large developers.Apple stock (ticker: AAPL) turned negative following the ruling. It closed down 3.3% to $148.97 on Friday, while the S&P 500 index fell 0.8%.In other parts of the Epic lawsuit, the judge ruled with Apple, including that Epic breached its contract when an update to its Fortnite app allowed users to bypass Apple’s payment system. Apple removed Fortnite, prompting a public relations and legal blitz from Epic. The judge ordered Epic to pay damages equal to 30% of the $12.17 million in sales Fortnite collected from iOS devices between August and October 2020 and 30% of any revenue since then.“This was a legal blow for Apple and will clearly loosen the company’s iron grip on its App Store Gaming revenues,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told Barron’s.Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar noted that users will ultimately choose between price and ease of use when weighing Apple’s payment system against others.“Overall, we do not believe today’s announcement has a major impact on the company’s upcoming launch event on September 14,” Kumar added. “In addition, we do not believe it has a material impact on the broader business at this point in time.”Apple, in a statement, highlighted that the court found the App Store is not in violation in antitrust law, noting that “success is not illegal.”“Apple faces rigorous competition in every segment in which we do business, and we believe customers and developers choose us because our products and services are the best in the world,” the company added. “We remain committed to ensuring the App Store is a safe and trusted marketplace that supports a thriving developer community and more than 2.1 million U.S. jobs, and where the rules apply equally to everyone.”Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, who has been a vocal opponent of Apple’s App Store restrictions, said on Twitter that the decision is not a win for developers or consumers, partly because the ruling calls for links to alternative payment systems but not in-app payments on par with what Apple offers. “Epic is fighting for fair competition among in-app payment methods and app stores for a billion consumers,” he said. “Fortnite will return to the iOS App Store when and where Epic can offer in-app payment in fair competition with Apple in-app payment, passing along the savings to consumers.”Sweeney added that the company will fight on. An Epic Games spokesperson confirmed the company plans to appeal the decision.Apple said earlier this month that it would allow certain apps to offer such links, but that change excluded games.Write to Connor Smith at connor.smith@barrons.com;3

Barclays, Citigroup, JPMorgan, Royal Bank of Scotland and UBS are facing a £1 billion ($1.23 billion) class action lawsuit over rigging the foreign exchange markets — one of the biggest cases of its kind in the UK.It comes just months after European regulators hit many of the same banks with a €1 billion-plus penalty for manipulation of these same markets between 2007 and 2013.The new suit alleges that end investors, including pension funds, lost out as a result of the manipulation and deserve compensation. It was filed at London’s Competition Appeal Tribunal by Scott+Scott, the US law firm.It mirrors a $2.3 billion class action overseen by Scott+Scott two years ago. The firm has opened a European office to lead the new claim, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.The news was first reported by Reuters.

203;30/12/2016;Apple Reportedly Cutting iPhone Production...Again;Apple Reportedly Cutting iPhone Production...Again. Apple CEO Tim Cook called the company’s AirPods earphones “a runaway success” this week and noted that the Apple can’t make them fast enough to keep up with demand. That doesn’t appear to be the case with the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus.The company is reportedly cutting iPhone production by approximately 10%, according to the Nikkei Asian Review. That’s based on calculations from suppliers. Apple ended up trimming production around this time last year, too, the Nikkei Review says. That’s because of an inventory pile-up after the iPhone 6 and 6s didn’t sell as well as planned. The article notes that the smartphone company tried to learn from those mistakes by cutting production of the 7 and 7 Plus by 20% at the outset, but the phones still haven’t been flying off shelves. That could be because the new phones don’t have many features that you couldn’t also find on prior models, so people aren’t inclined to upgrade. And while the 7 Plus has a fancy new camera, the Nikkei Review mentions that Apple is having trouble getting enough camera sensors for its bigger iPhone model.These are some worrisome trends, but Apple doesn’t need to rely on new phone sales as much as it did in the past. The company’s “services” business, made up of things like the App Store and iCloud Storage, is growing quickly. As long as people are still buying music and movies from the iTunes Store and Apple Music, it might not matter too much what kind of phone they use. Meanwhile, the entire production issue could be moot given that 2017, when Apple celebrates the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, has a major launch in store -- the iPhone 8. Apple shares were down 0.8% in Friday trading, to $115.78. For 2016, the stock has returned 12.5%, including dividends, exactly on par with the S&P 500. Big Picture: Apple appears to be cutting production of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. That implies that the phones haven’t been selling as well as the company had predicted.;4

But the company is capturing some of the interest in hands-free communications through its (still) sold-out AirPod earphones. One analyst thinks Apple is popularizing a hot new category -- call it the “hearable.” Apple is not the only one making smart earphones, and, in fact, rivals’ offerings are arguably smarter. AirPods don’t (yet) have biometric-tracking capabilities, like Samsung’s IconX, which can measure your heart rate. But the AirPods do allow you to play music and dictate messages without tapping on a phone or even on the pods themselves, though, in practice, that capability needs some improvement. “AirPods may not be perfect, but they’ll get better, smarter, and easier to use,” wrote Andrew Murphy, a former Piper Jaffray analyst who now works at venture-capital firm Loup Ventures. “They are just the beginning for hearables and a new wave of computing.”Soon enough, Murphy says, people might end up keeping their phones in their pockets most of the time. They can use speech to give Siri commands, and check all their incoming notifications using an Apple Watch. The problem with voice-controlled devices is they’re not always accurate. In Loup’s study of the Echo and Home, the firm found that the devices answered less than 40% of basic queries correctly. Apple’s Siri, which powers AirPods’ listening skills, also often struggles to get things right. She’s learning Shanghainese, her 22nd language, but misunderstands us about half the time when we ask her, in English, to turn off the lights.“We’re early in the transition to audio as a dominant input for computing,” Murphy wrote. Big Picture: An industry analyst thinks that smart earphones like Apple’s AirPods are popularizing a new device category known as hearables.;4
1087;29/03/2016;3M targets new products to aid sales growth;"3M targets new products to aid sales growth. 3M Co. is counting on offsetting modest sales growth in the coming years with lower costs and creating new products out of its well-known consumer brands and industrial materials.3M, the maker of Post-it Notes, Scotch-Brite cleaning pads, Ace bandages and Filtrete furnace filters, expects base sales, which exclude revenue from acquisitions, to expand by 2% to 5% annually from 2016 through 2020. That is down from the company's previous long-range base sales growth target of 4% to 6% annually. Weakening demand from key overseas markets and slowing industrial activity have limited 3M's sales growth to about 3% annually in recent years, prompting the scaled down outlook.The St. Paul, Minn., company predicted that its earnings per share will grow at an annual rate of 8% to 11% through 2020, compared with its previous five-year target of 9% to 11% annually. Chief Executive Inge Thulin described the new goals as ""aggressive, but realistic.""""We have a playbook that's working. We have a model where we're winning with our customers,"" Mr. Thulin said during a presentation Tuesday to analysts.3M's new-product strategies include expanding the market penetration of long-established products with new features and capabilities, such as Super Sticky Post-it Notes and water-resistant Ace-brand wrist braces. Other new products are derived from adapting the company's existing materials to new applications, including using of Thinsulate insulation to deaden noise in auto interiors and new abrasive products that feature the grit granules used in 3M's sandpaper.New industrial products last year accounted for $100 million in sales, propelling the industrial unit's goal of adding $600 million in additional revenue from 2015 to 2017.""Innovation is the heart beat of the company,"" Chief Financial Officer Nick Gangestad said.To stay ahead of sluggish demand from key end markets and geographic regions, Mr. Thulin is pushing a streamlined business structure with lower costs. 3M has realigned its businesses into six large groups focused on health care, consumer products, industrial, electronics and safety and graphics.3M's overall operating margin for 2015 was 22.9%. The company, though, is doubling down on cost reductions to aid further margin expansion. 3M is targeting $500 million to $700 million in annual operating expense reductions by 2020. As much as half of the saving would come from overhauling and simplifying the company's supply chain.Meanwhile, Mr. Thulin said he's mostly satisfied with the composition of the company's business portfolio, after last year evaluating the sale of businesses accounting for $2.5 billion in annual revenue. Mr. Thulin backed away from the sale of the health information unit last year, after concluding the business offered new investment opportunities3M on Tuesday also affirmed its 2016 base sales growth forecast of 1% to 3% with earnings per share in a range $8.10 to $8.453M's stock was recently down 1.2% at $164.21.Write to Bob Tita at robert.tita@wsj.com";4
565;08/04/2020;GM to Make 30,000 Ventilators for National Stockpile;GM to Make 30,000 Ventilators for National Stockpile. General MotorsCo. is making 30,000 ventilators for the national stockpile in a $489.4 million contract with the Department of Health and Human Services, as surging Covid-19 cases have tested medical capacities across the U.S.Under the contract, struck under the Defense Production Act, GM is expected to deliver 6,132 ventilators by June 1 and the remainder by the end of August, the department said Wednesday.GM said it is working with Ventec Life Systems to make the ventilators.President Trump last week moved to use the Defense Production Act, a Korean War-era national-security mobilization law, to help major manufacturers secure supplies companies need to make ventilators and respirators. 3MCo. , the primary U.S. producer of N95 masks, has stepped up production, with Ford MotorCo. helping with the effort.Initially reluctant to use the DPA, Mr. Trump has pressed private companies, including GM, to begin making the medical equipment and supplies.“By rating contracts under the DPA, HHS is helping manufacturers like GM get the supplies they need to produce ventilators as quickly as possible, while also ensuring that these ventilators are routed through the Strategic National Stockpile to where they’re needed most,” Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said.Ventilators are in crucial short supply as the coronavirus pandemic spreads across the U.S., and cases are swelling in major metro areas, such as New York. The federal government’s national stockpile has sent out nearly half of its ventilators and has fewer than 10,000 still in hand.;4
468;24/09/2021;The iPhone 13 Is Here. It’s a Big Day for Consumers—and Investors;The iPhone 13 Is Here. It’s a Big Day for Consumers—and Investors. New Apple iPhone models hit the stores Friday. While the launch is generally a big event for tech enthusiasts eager to wait in line for the latest gadget, traders often steer clear.A Barron’s analysis of a decade’s worth of trading data shows that Apple (ticker: AAPL) shares have declined in the week after an iPhone release in eight of the last 10 years. Over that period, Apple shares are down an average of 0.9% during the five trading days after the release. The exceptions are 2013’s release of the iPhone 5S and 2018’s iPhone XS, when Apple shares rose 3% and 2.2%, respectively, in the five subsequent trading days.In an e-mail to Barron’s, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives characterized the trend of traders selling Apple stock around launch as a knee-jerk reaction.“That has and continues to be the wrong move as the skeptics fight the pure momentum and pent up demand of these upgrade cycles,” Ives said. “This [year] is no different as we believe Apple is on pace to be a $3 trillion market cap in 2022 despite the haters continuing to hate,” he adds.Indeed, buying the dip has often paid off. Over the last 10 years, if you bought Apple stock a week after the flagship iPhone release, you’d have an average gain of 3.2% through year end. Excluding 2013 and 2018—when Apple stock actually rose around the release—brings the average gain to 5.9%. That 2018 year actually ended up being Apple’s worst post-iPhone release performance. The stock declined 28% from the close on Sept. 20 through Dec. 31, because investors were spooked by Apple’s decision to no longer offer unit sales data for iPhones. The selloff wound up being a historic buying opportunity, though. Apple shares gained 86% in 2019, leading all gainers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on the year.Most tech reviewers have declared the the iPhone 13 an incremental upgrade. Still, early indicators of demand look positive. Ives estimates global pre-orders are running 20% ahead of last year’s iPhone 12 models. The iPhone 13 Mini starts at $699, while the base iPhone 13 goes for $799. The iPhone 13 Pro starts at $999, and the iPhone 13 Pro Max starts at $1,099. Apple shares finished Thursday up 0.7% to $146.83. If the historical trend continues, expect a short-lived dip for the stock in the coming days.Write to Connor Smith at connor.smith@barrons.com;4
304;07/04/2021;Goldman Sachs Downgraded Chevron Stock. Here Are the Oil Stocks to Buy Instead.;Goldman Sachs Downgraded Chevron Stock. Here Are the Oil Stocks to Buy Instead.. For the past few years, Chevron has been the default stock for many investors looking to gain exposure to oil and gas without taking a big risk. Chevron’s balance sheet is considered safer than those of its competitors, and Wall Street has believed its dividend safe even during the depths of the coronavirus crisis. But despite Chevron stock’s (ticker: CVX) 5% dividend yield, some of its competitors are showing improvements and trading at more discounted valuations. On Tuesday, Goldman Sachs analyst Neil Mehta downgraded Chevron to Neutral from Buy, recommending that investors look elsewhere for larger gains. Chevron stock remains relatively attractive, but other stocks now stand out more, he argues. That includes Exxon Mobil (XOM), ConocoPhillips (COP) and European majors like BP (BP), Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A), and Total (TOT).“To be clear, we do not view the Chevron valuation as expensive on an absolute basis or versus history,” Mehta wrote. “We simply see better total return elsewhere among global oils after multiple years of strong performance.”Mehta values Chevron at $113. The stock fell 0.9% on Tuesday to $103.58. Chevron has gained 23% this year.Chevron is more expensive on a price-to-earnings and free-cash-flow-yield basis, Mehta writes. And because the analyst thinks oil prices will stay relatively high, he says investors should consider slightly riskier names. Exxon stock has 8% more upside than Chevron, Mehta argues. And the European majors have 36% more upside, on average.Write to editors@barrons.com;5
150;12/06/2019;The Bull Case and the Bear Case on Apple Stock;"The Bull Case and the Bear Case on Apple Stock. Apple has been one of the most important stock stories of 2019—and it’s easy to see why. It’s one of the world’s biggest companies, widely held, and a useful window into global trade, technological trends, and the direction of the market itself. All that has occasionally led Apple to resemble a volatile trading stock. From September 2018 highs above $230 through early January, Apple stock (ticker: AAPL) had tumbled 40% near the halfway point. The stock gained much of that back by early May before trade worries caused the stock to fall again. The stock, trading at about $195 in mid-June, is up about 23% in 2019, ahead of the S&P 500. Strong convictions from bulls and bears have contributed to the volatility. Here’s the bull case and the bear case on Apple stock.• Have we reached peak iPhone? If you’re down on Apple stock, you likely think so. Sales of iPhones have flatlined, and Apple recently stopped disclosing the number of phones sold. That has some investors assuming the worst. Wall Street estimates that Apple will sell 142 million iPhones in 2019, down from 167 million the year before, and in line with the number sold in 2017. Apple has managed to push up the price of the average iPhone sold, from $652 in 2017 to an estimated $768. But that, predictably, has hurt demand. It’s unclear whether the next generation of iPhones, due in the fall, could re-energize demand. Wall Street isn’t expecting much, as analysts see essentially flat iPhone unit sales in 2020, as well. • The outlook for iPhone sales could be complicated by ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China. If tariffs expand to more goods—as threatened by President Donald Trump—iPhones could fall under a 25% tariff. That would leave Apple with a difficult choice: raise prices and risk losing sales, or eat the tariffs and accept narrower margins. Protracted trade tensions with China could also hurt demand for Apple products in China, some analysts suggest. And looking up the supply chain, there is risk to the supply of raw materials Apple and other tech companies use.• Apple hopes its services business will more than pick up the iPhone slack. The company recently launched a paid subscription news service and has plans for streaming video and videogames next. That builds on Apple Music, AppleCare, and iCloud. The competition in those markets, however—including Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon.com (AMZN), and Netflix (NFLX)—is well-heeled and already established. Legal challenges to the fees Apple charges in its App Store may also endanger future profits, though those challenges may take years to resolve. (Were the App Store matter to lead to an antitrust case against Apple, that could further weigh on the shares, though some analysts appear bullish on a breakup.)In any case, for Apple bears, services can’t make up for the flagging iPhone. “Efficient group communication around services cannot compensate for the reality of a shrinking core iPhone product,” HSBC’s Erwan Rambourg wrote in May. • Finally, there’s Tim Cook—the CEO who, bears like to point out, isn’t Steve Jobs. Critics think Cook isn’t the right person to maintain the company’s place as a leader in innovation. They’re hoping for more dramatic moves, perhaps including a major acquisition, that could quickly open up a product line. (A videogame studio is sometimes discussed as a possibility, though so is Tesla [TSLA].)But while investors have been asking “who’s next?” for some time, a few are ready for change now. “Current management is better suited to operations and methodic execution than producing visionary new product and opening new categories,” Chatham Road Partners’ Colin Gillis wrote in April. • Slower iPhone growth may not be the nightmare it appears, Apple bulls suggest, because the size of the installed base will eventually pay off when it comes time to upgrade. Many analysts think 5G networks will drive even further upgrades. All that could lead to stronger streams of services revenue. “We believe Apple’s ecosystem approach, including an [installed] base which now exceeds 1.4 billion devices globally is leading to record services revenue, and we expect the higher-margin services revenue growth to continue outpacing total company growth.” Canaccord Genuity’s Michael Walkley wrote in early May. Services revenue was $37.2 billion for the fiscal year that ended in September 2018. That’s still a fraction of Apple’s $257 billion in total sales last year. Wall Street, however, expects services to top $80 billion by 2022, growing to more than half of gross profits by that time, according to FactSet. • Apple has grown several product categories into major businesses. AirPods have gone from curiosity to mainstream; the latest iPads are well-reviewed; and the Apple Watch jump-started the growth of the wearables category. Virtual and augmented reality, as well as innovation in the health care space—particularly through the Apple Watch—could keep that rolling, a likelihood investors may be undervaluing. “When the iPhone (once in a generation product) becomes the basis of comparison, everything else, however successful, looks incremental,” Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Wamsi Mohan wrote in May. • Apple has committed itself to shareholder return through continued dividends and stock buybacks. Its massive cash hoard—approaching $40 billion recently—and free cash flow generation gives it wide leeway to invest in growth, while also rewarding shareholders. • Meanwhile, It’s hard to argue with Cook’s success. Since he took over in mid-2011, Apple stock is up some 260%, well ahead of the S&P 500.Apple stock is up about 2% over the last 12 months, a bit behind the S&P 500. It’s currently trading at about 16 times estimated earnings for the next 12 months, a slightly premium to its five-year average of 13.6 times. Wall Street’s average price target on Apple shares is around $210, according to FactSet, with the average rating a Buy. Analysts’ price targets range from $150 to $245.

596;27/08/2021;HP Inc. and Dell Stock Look Attractive and Cheap. Here’s Why.;"HP Inc. and Dell Stock Look Attractive and Cheap. Here’s Why.. One peculiar outcome of the pandemic has been a newfound appreciation for the personal computer. The humble PC had been out of the spotlight for years. Eclipsed by the rise of smartphones, the PC had become a stale, dull, largely underappreciated appliance—technology’s toaster. In 2019, when unit sales inched up just 2.7%, that actually was good news for the industry, because it was the first year of global unit growth since 2011. But last year, with schools, offices, retail stores, and most everything else shut down by Covid-19, the lowly PC became a lifeline, a means to stay in touch and keep working. However, the average American household had barely more than one computer, which didn’t cut it for the typical family of four. The pandemic also underlined the need to upgrade to hardware capable of running videoconferencing and other essential software. Result: a personal computer boom. Sales rose 13.1% in 2020, says International Data Group, with a 14.2% jump expected for 2021.This revival has boosted the fortunes of Apple (ticker: AAPL), Dell Technologies (DELL), and HP Inc. (HPQ). Earlier this year, demand jumped into ludicrous mode: In its March quarter, Apple posted 70% growth in Mac sales. In their April quarters, consumer PC sales rocketed upward by 72% at HP and 42% at Dell.But booms don’t last forever, and this one is showing signs of aging. In Apple’s June quarter, Mac sales were up 16%—still impressive, but a clear deceleration. The PC peripherals company Logitech International (LOGI), which had a 66% sales jump in its June quarter, cautioned that its top line would be flattish for its March 2022 fiscal year.That was all prelude to Thursday’s June-quarter earnings reports from Dell and HP. Investors were jittery heading into the announcements. For one thing, while the Delta variant might be muting the economic recovery, most schools are operating in person, and some businesses are beginning to return to the office. In addition, thesemiconductor component shortage is crimping growth at hardware companies, big and small. As it turned out, there were good reasons to be nervous.HP’s quarter was a bit of a stinker, though the company asserts that the issues were about supply, not demand. While profits handily beat guidance, thanks in part to some one-time gains, revenue, at $15.3 billion, missed the Street consensus by $600 million.HP CEO Enrique Lores tells Barron’s that the company could have shipped more products if it had more parts, in particular cheap, low-end integrated circuits like microcontrollers. Lores says HP exited the quarter with a backlog equal to a full quarter of sales—the most ever. “We are selling everything we can produce,” he says.Still, the numbers disappointed investors. Consumer PC revenue rose just 3%; commercial PC revenue was off 1%. At least in part, the latter reflected soft Chromebook sales, as schools slowed purchases. Lores is bullish on a rebound in enterprise demand as offices reopen. He sees Chromebook sales recovering by quarter end or shortly after, and consumer purchases being boosted by the coming rollout of Windows 11, the latest version of Microsoft’s flagship operating system. But the parts issue is clouding the picture and probably will remain an overhang on the stock, at least for now. That’s particularly true, given Dell’s results. Dell’s sales growth accelerated to 15% in the latest quarter, versus 12% in the previous one. That was its best quarterly gain since 2018. At Dell’s PC-centric Client Solutions Group, revenue rose 27%, up from 20%, with gains of 17% from consumers and 32% from commercial customers. In an interview, Dell CFO Tom Sweet said that both PC and enterprise hardware sales would have been even higher with better component availability. Like Lores, he sees the problem lingering into 2022. Sweet notes that Dell has kept margins flat, in part by ratcheting up prices to offset higher costs. Dell also seems to be managing its supply chain better than HP. And it’s clearly taking market share.Still, Dell ’s enterprise hardware business came in a little light, and storage demand overall remains flat; the enterprise spending boom isn’t quite here yet. For the stock, the bigger issue was that results from VMware (VMW) disappointed the Street. Over half of Dell’s market cap reflects its 81% VMware stake, which it will spin off to Dell shareholders in early November. VMware’s earnings met expectations at the top line, but the business mix underwhelmed investors, who want a faster shift to the cloud. That said, both HP and Dell should get a boost from an expected pickup in IT spending, and both stocks look cheap. HP bought back $1.5 billion of shares in the quarter, and Lores argues that it’s undervalued, with more buybacks coming. As for Dell, it will use the proceeds from a special dividend that VMware will issue to holders, right before the spinoff, to pay down more than $10 billion in debt, a move that should spur ratings agencies to upgrade Dell’s credit to investment grade. And while the air might slowly be coming out of the personal computer boom, the risks for both stocks look modest. HP trades for about eight times expected fiscal 2022 profits. Dell is nearly as cheap, and merits a fresh look when the dust settles on the VMware spinoff. Buy them both. And maybe a new PC, too; it could be time. Write to Eric J.

83;14/12/2021;Apple Stock Gets an Upgrade on Potential for AR/VR Headsets;Apple Stock Gets an Upgrade on Potential for AR/VR Headsets. Apple received some new love from Wall Street as analysts continue to ratchet up their expectations for the stock to factor in the potential for the company’s so-far unannounced entry into the market for augmented- and virtual-reality hardware.As noted in the most recent Barron’s Tech Trader column, analysts have begun revising their target prices and earnings models for Apple (ticker: AAPL) shares to reflect the anticipated debut of the company’s AR/VR headset, or glasses, or whatever the product turns out to be, about a year from now. On Monday, J.P. Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee raised his target for the stock price to $210, from $180. That compares with the share price of a bit more than $174 Tuesday morning.Chatterjee declared Apple stock his top pick for 2022, joining Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who recently said the same. Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani on Tuesday said the shares are among his favorite choices for 2022.BofA Global Research analyst Wamsi Mohan raised his rating on Apple shares to Buy from Neutral, while boosting his target on the stock to $210, from $160. He cited the expected arrival of an AR/VR headset in making the call. “We view this technology as a game-changer as it will enable many new applications which will require high performance hardware and higher access speeds,” he wrote in a Tuesday research note.While some analysts worry that AR/VR glasses could eventually replace the iPhone as a primary connectivity device, Mohan said that he thinks iPhone sales in fiscal 2023 sales will be better than some expect. Augmented reality could become “the killer app” for 5G devices, while the AR/VR category offers new opportunities for Apple’s services business, he said.Mohan thinks Apple will continue to aggressively return capital to holders, and also noted that many institutional investors remain underweight Apple relative to the S&P 500. They could boost their positions ahead of the AR/VR launch next year, he said. Daryanani, the Evercore ISI analyst who named Apple as a top pick for 2022, repeated his Outperform rating and boosted his target price on the stock to $200, from $180. In a research note, Daryanani said he thinks Apple can sustain growth in earnings per share in the mid teens, “driven by a host of secular levers,” in particular growth in both wearables and services. He said Apple’s services arm can reach $100 billion in revenue by fiscal 2025, and that he sees a path for wearables to become a $75 billion business.Daryanani’s other top picks for next year include the connector company Amphenol (APH), networking companies Arista Networks (ANET), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Ciena (CIEN), and the IT services provider CDW (CDW).After a recent surge of nearly 20% that took the company’s market capitalization close to $3 trillion—a milestone no other public company has ever reached— Apple shares have succumbed to some modest profit taking. Tuesday morning, the stock was down 0.7%, on a day when the Nasdaq Composite was off 1.2%. At $174.38, the stock is less than a 5% rally away from the $3 trillion mark.Write to Eric J.

37;06/12/2021;Morgan Stanley boosts ratings on banks ahead of expected interest rate hikes;Morgan Stanley boosts ratings on banks ahead of expected interest rate hikes. Morgan Stanley on Monday boosted ratings on two banks and issued bullish comments on others, saying the sector was the most likely to outperform when interest rates rise.While jitters around the omicron variant have pushed bank stock prices down in recent sessions, Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck advised clients to “buy the dip” in bank stocks.“We’ve seen this movie before,” Graseck said. “Virus hits, scientists create vaccine to address virus. If omicron needs a new vaccine, Pfizer and Moderna say it is 1Q production, 2Q distribution. At worst, from an economic perspective only, we think this drives one quarter of slower growth, with no lockdowns in the U.S.”She said banks have outperformed the S&P 500 SPX more than any other sector during periods of rising rates. They’re also the only sector that outperforms during periods of rising real yields. Roughly, a 25 basis point interest rake hike by the Fed will add about 1.5% to earnings per share to banks, she said.And recent indications from the Fed suggest more than one quarter-point rate hike may be expected in 2022. Read more about rate expectations in MarketWatch’s “The Fed” column.The SPDR S&P Bank exchange-traded fund KBE was up 3.1% in morning trading Monday. The ETF has lost 4.3% over the past months, while the S&P 500 has slipped 2.6%.Graseck highlighted as top plays six stocks: Ally Financial Inc. ALLY, Alliance Data Systems Corp. ADS, Capital One Financial Corp. COF, Regions Financial Corp., RF, State Street Corp. STT, Synchrony Financial SYF and Wells Fargo & Co. WFC. She upgraded Wells Fargo to equal-weight from underweight, with a $61 price target, and boosted its view on Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS to equal-weight from underweight with a price target of $479. Meanwhile, Graseck trimmed her rating on Citigroup Inc. C to equal-weight from overweight, with a price target of $82, on a lack of catalysts for the stock. She also cut Bank of New York Mellon Corp. BK to equal-weight with a price target of $59, on valuation and low loan exposure, and PNC Financial Services Group Inc. PNC to underweight from equal-weight, with a price target of $209.For the omicron bounceback, Morgan Stanley favors Synchrony Financial and Capital One, because they’re trading close to their price-to-earnings ratio lows, just as loan growth is expected to take off, she said.For rate hikes, the “clear winners” are Wells Fargo and State Street, “given their rate sensitivities and attractive valuation.” She sees potential share price upside of 28% for Wells Fargo and 42% upside for State Street.For commercial loan growth, Morgan Stanley spotlighted Regions Financial, which has a big exposure to commercial and industrial lending.“While significant risks around the timing of asset cap removal and further regulatory action remain, probability of higher rates sooner skews the risk-reward more favorably,” Graseck said about Wells Fargo.Shares of Wells Fargo jumped 4% on Monday. The stock is up 65% this year, compared with a gain of 22.1% by the S&P 500. In other Monday trades, Goldman Sachs rose 2.5% and Citigroup rose 0.7% and BNY Mellon added 1.5% and PNC advanced by 1.7%.;5

663;06/08/2021;Big Tech is suffering from a ‘Great Resignation’ of workers, who say ‘It’s a good time to leave’;"Big Tech is suffering from a ‘Great Resignation’ of workers, who say ‘It’s a good time to leave’. A confluence of factors have led the rank and file at Big Tech companies to leave what were coveted jobs a decade ago for the potential riches of startups and young public companies, with some participants calling it the “Great Resignation.”In much the same way that Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.25%, Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, +0.05% GOOG, +0.19%, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -1.06%, Facebook Inc. FB, -0.06%, and others lured workers from mature and seemingly staid tech giants like International Business Machines Corp. IBM, +2.44% a decade ago, a new generation of upstarts flush with cash from venture capitalists and Wall Street is aiming for their employees. More than a dozen Big Tech defectors recently contacted by MarketWatch said they were wooed by a potential for an initial public offering, the chance to make a splash at a smaller company, and the opportunity to escape the stigma of working at some of tech’s biggest names.“There has been a burst of activity [of people leaving]. If anything, the pandemic delayed decisions,” says Raymond Endres, chief technology officer at Airtable, a low-code app-building platform he joined in mid-May after a decade at Facebook, most recently as vice president of engineering for Facebook Messenger.“It is a good time to leave. There’s a lot of funding, competition and great opportunities,” Endres said.Some employees who recently left Big Tech are calling it the “Great Resignation,” and they blame COVID-19-related job burnout, which could also be a widespread problem — Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.43% research found 41% of the global workforce is weighing leaving their current employer this year. In tech specifically, about one-third of more than 2,800 information-technology professionals said they plan to look for a new job in the next few months, according to a recent Robert Half International survey, while employers posted more than 365,000 IT job openings in June, the highest monthly total since September 2019, according to trade group CompTIA.A confluence of factors have led to “a Big Tech sojourn,” Columbia Business School professor Adam Galinsky told MarketWatch. Workers at major tech employers are considering a jump to smaller companies because of pandemic burnout that has forced many to re-evaluate their jobs and seek more control; resistance to being forced to go to the office on a big campus at least twice a week; and frustrations at working within vast bureaucracies where change is glacial and outside criticism is fierce.Opinion: Some tech workers are leaving San Francisco. They won’t be missedRan Mokady left Amazon, where he was general manager of an Alexa division, to become chief product officer at Intuition Robotics, a startup working in AI and robotics for older adults.“I was attracted to the mission; getting up in the morning and making people’s lives better,” Mokady told MarketWatch. “The pandemic caused me to re-evaluate things, after sitting at home for a year.”A white-hot tech IPO market — there have been 84 offerings so far in the U.S. this year at $50.4 billion, compared with 65 in 2020 for $38.7 billion, according to Dealogic — has would-be employees lining up to make money, and an impact, in short order. In July alone, there were at least 30.“There’s lot of [IPO] money out there,” says Kelly Soderlund, who decamped from software giant SAP SAP, -0.69% in December 2020 to join TripActions, a travel-management company. “Employees have never been in such a position of power. It’s an interesting inflection point within the market.”Read: The 20 best-performing IPOs of the past three years have returned up to 1,477%VC money is also at record highs. This year is on track to be venture’s “best year yet,” according to PitchBook. Through June, $150 billion has been raised among about 7,000 deals, ahead of last year’s record total of $164.3 billion in 12,362 deals. Nearly 200 megadeals at or exceeding $100 million closed in the second quarter, bringing this year’s total to $85.5 billion across 385 such deals.Renchu Song, engineering manager at TigerGraph, left for Facebook last year but quickly returned. “Working at a startup, you have more connection with employees, and things move faster,” Song told MarketWatch. TigerGraph, which has also hired ex-Googlers, plans to increase its workforce this year to about 300 from 90.Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google representatives did not respond to emails seeking comment. Microsoft referred to its aforementioned survey of the workplace.Sometimes, workers come in clusters from another company. Consider Nestlé NESN, +0.08% subsidiary Freshly. Six executives — including its chief commercialization officer, senior vice president of brand and partnerships, and executive innovation chef — have come from Amazon since January. “I thought I would be a lifer at Amazon,” Freshly Chief Commercialization Officer Anna Fabrega told MarketWatch, commenting on her 10 years at the e-commerce giant. “But this was a tremendous opportunity. I can have a far greater impact and more influence on the company’s trajectory, which quite frankly was harder at Amazon.”Don’t miss: How long will the Silicon Valley employees who can’t work from home keep getting paid?Many mentioned the chance to have an impact at a smaller company, after years of massive growth at Big Tech companies. In November, Pat McQueen left Salesforce.com Inc. CRM, -2.31% after 17 years to lead operations and sales engineering at Copado, a startup in the developer tools market. “I have a chance to build strategy at Copado, and not implement someone else’s strategy,” McQueen told MarketWatch. “And I think Copado is on a path to being the next unicorn. It’s pretty exciting.”";6

The program will be focused on reducing overhead costs, largely in the U.S. as well as slower-growing markets, particularly its Europe/Middle East and Africa business and Latin America. 3M has a global workforce of roughly 90,000 employees.The company also anticipates pretax cost savings of $130 million for next year.3M has been working to tidy up its vast portfolio of products, which include Scotch tape, kitchen sponges and materials used in making computer screens. Meanwhile, 3M continues to add more products through acquisitions and new combinations of its core technologies in such areas as films, adhesives and coatings.3M recently announced the sales of a provider of automated checkout systems for libraries and a French maker of license plates and highway signs. Earlier this year, 3M paid $1.8 billion for Capital Safety, a maker of harnesses and other items designed to protect workers.In addition to watching for any signs that the portfolio changes are boosting sales, investors also were expected to be on the lookout during the conference call for signs of how weaker demand for computers, smartphones and tablets is affecting the outlook for 3M's materials that are used in semiconductors and other electronic components.For the latest quarter, electronics and energy-segment sales, excluding currency, fell 2.8%.Overall, 3M reported a profit of $1.3 billion, or $2.05 a share, essentially flat from a year earlier, when the company earned $1.98 on a per-share basis.

466;27/09/2021;Chinese factories grapple with power cuts;Chinese factories grapple with power cuts. BEIJING (AP) — Global shoppers face possible shortages of smartphones and other goods ahead of Christmas after power cuts to meet government energy use targets forced Chinese factories to shut down and left some households in the dark.In the northeastern city of Liaoyang, 23 people were hospitalized with gas poisoning after ventilation in a metal casting factory was shut off following a power outage, according to state broadcaster CCTV. No deaths were reported.A components supplier for Apple Inc.’s AAPL, -0.20% iPhones said it suspended production at a factory west of Shanghai under orders from local authorities.The disruption to China’s vast manufacturing industries during one of their busiest seasons reflects the ruling Communist Party’s struggle to balance economic growth with efforts to rein in pollution and emissions of climate-changing gases.“Beijing’s unprecedented resolve in enforcing energy consumption limits could result in long-term benefits, but the short-term economic costs are substantial,” Nomura economists Ting Lu, Lisheng Wang and Jing Wang said in a report Monday.They cut their economic growth forecast for China to 4.7% from 5.1% over a year earlier in the current quarter. They cut their outlook for annual growth to 7.7% from 8.2%.Global financial markets already were on edge about the possible collapse of one of China’s biggest real estate developers, Evergrande Group 3333, +1.26%, which is struggling to avoid a default on billions of dollars of debt.Manufacturers already are facing shortages of processor chips, disruptions in shipping and other lingering effects of the global shutdown of travel and trade to fight the coronavirus pandemic.Residents of China’s northeast, where autumn temperatures are falling, report power cuts and have appealed on social media for the government to restore supplies.The crunch comes as global leaders prepare to attend a U.N. environmental conference by video link on Oct. 12-13 in the southwestern city of Kunming. That increases pressure on President Xi Jinping’s government to stick to emissions and energy efficiency targets.The ruling party also is preparing for the Winter Olympics in the Chinese capital, Beijing, and the nearby city of Shijiazhuang in February, a period when it will want clear blue skies.Scores of companies have announced power rationing could force them to delay filling orders and might hurt them financially.Apple components supplier Eson Precision Engineering Co. Ltd. said Sunday it would halt production at its factory in Kunshan, west of Shanghai, through Thursday “in line with the local government’s power restriction policy.”Eson said the suspension shouldn’t have a “significant impact” on operations.Apple didn’t immediately respond to a question about the possible impact on iPhone supplies.China’s energy consumption and industrial emissions have surged as manufacturers rush to fill foreign demand at a time when competitors elsewhere still are hampered by anti-coronavirus controls.China’s economy is “more driven by exports than any time in the past decade,” but official energy use targets fail to take that into account, economists Larry Hu and Xinyu Ji of Macquarie Group said in a report.Some provinces used up most of their official quotas for energy consumption in the first half of the year and are cutting back to stay under their limits, according to Li Shuo, a climate policy expert at Greenpeace in Beijing.Utility companies, meanwhile, are being squeezed by soaring coal and gas prices. That discourages them from increasing output because the government constrains their ability to pass on costs to customers, said Li.Prices have risen “past the range of what China’s electricity industry can bear,” Li said.China has launched repeated campaigns to make its energy-hungry economy more efficient and clean up smog-choked cities.City skies are visibly clearer, but the abrupt way the campaigns are carried out disrupts supplies of power, coal and gas, leaving families shivering in unheated homes and forcing factories to shut down.Shopping malls in the northeastern city of Harbin have announced they will close stores earlier than usual to save power.In Guangdong province in the south, the government told the public to set thermostats on air conditioners higher even as temperatures rose above 34 degrees C (93 degrees F).State Grid Corp., the world’s biggest power distributor, issued a pledge to ensure adequate supplies.Meanwhile, state media say local governments have signed long-term coal contracts to ensure adequate suppliers.;7
333;08/09/2017;How Hurricanes Harvey and Irma are affecting health care companies;"How Hurricanes Harvey and Irma are affecting health care companies. With Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Harvey hitting the U.S., the devastating storms are expected to and have affected health care companies with business in those parts of the country, from hospital chains to medical technology facilities and parts of the pharmaceutical supply chain. Hospital chains are chief among them, since hurricane activity can and has damaged hospital property, required patient relocation and disrupted care. With Hurricane Irma headed toward the Florida coast, the five hospital companies that appear to have the most Florida exposure are Tenet Healthcare Corporation THC, -1.78%, Surgery Partners Inc. SGRY, -2.83%, HCA Holdings Inc. HCA, -0.10%, Envision Healthcare US:EVHC and Community Health Systems CYH, -2.63%, according to Raymond James analyst John Ransom. Take Hurricane Matthew last October, which hit the Florida coast and eventually developed into a Category 5 hurricane; by contrast, Hurricane Irma is a Category 5 storm already. Hurricane Matthew affected companies in different ways. It cost Tenet hospitals an estimated $5 to $10 million and Tenet surgery centers an estimated $1.5 to $2 million, and cost Surgery Partners about $1.5 to $2 million, Ransom noted.Read: Harvey likely to have modest impact on HCA results: MizuhoCommunity Health Systems said that Hurricane Matthew had a negative impact but didnâ€™t specifically quantify it. HCA said the 2016 hurricane caused â€œminor disruptionâ€ but no major issues. For a company like MEDNAX Inc. MD, +0.56%, which provides physician services and for which Florida is one of its largest states, â€œthe bigger impact will likely come from office-based practices, which are more exposed to closures and/or rescheduling,â€ Ransom said. Related: U.S. stocks turn lower as investors wrestle with ECB, Hurricane IrmaA number of medical technology companies also have facilities in areas hit by or expected to be hit by Hurricane Irma, including C.R.

SYK, -2.86% and Zimmer Biomet ZBH, +0.05%, according to Needham analyst Mike Matson. â€œWe estimate that the two storms (Harvey and Irma) could result in a procedural growth drag of ~30 bps for each week that hospitals are out of commission and/or patients are displaced,â€ Matson said. â€œWe believe this impact could last anywhere from 2-4 weeks, resulting in an estimated 60-120 bps drag on U.S. procedure growth in 3Q17.â€See more: Death toll rises to 10 as Hurricane Irma barrels through Caribbean, heads for FloridaPharmacies were also likely affected by Hurricane Harvey, noted UBS analyst Michael Cherny.

Together, these factors will determine if/when these stores return to pre-storm traffic levels.â€The major stock indexes swung between gains and losses Thursday, in part because of hurricane fears.

The record number of nominees of color yielded only only two Black winners, including RuPaul for “RuPaul’s Drag Race” and Michaela Coel for “I May Destroy You.”Netflix’s NFLX, -1.12% “The Crown” stars Olivia Colman and Josh O’Connor won the top drama acting honors Sunday, with Jason Sudeikis, star of Apple’s AAPL, -0.20% warm-hearted “Ted Lasso,” and Jean Smart of the generation-gap story “Hacks,” winners on the comedy side.Colman and O’Connor were a winning fictional mother-son duo: She plays Queen Elizabeth II, with O’Connor as Prince Charles in the British royal family saga that combines gravitas and soap opera.“I’d have put money on that not happening,” Colman said of the award, calling it “a lovely end to the most extraordinary journey” with the show’s cast and creators. She cut her remarks short, explaining why she was growing tearful.“I lost my daddy during COVID, and he would have loved all of this.” she said.O’Connor gave a shoutout to Emma Corwin, who played opposite him as Princess Diana and was also a nominee Sunday, as a “force of nature.”He also offered thanks to his grandparents, including his grandmother who died a few months ago, and his grandfather, Peter O’Connor, for the “greatest gifts” of kindness and loyalty.”Sudeikis, who also produces the series that many viewers found a balm for tough pandemic times, gave a speech that evoked the chipper, upbeat character he plays in the series about a U.K. soccer team and its unlikely American coach.“This show’s about families and mentors and teammates, and I wouldn’t be here without those things in my life,” said Sudeikis. He also thanked his fellow castmates, saying “I’m only as good as you guys make me look.”Smart, who received a standing ovation, began her acceptance speech on a somber note: Her husband actor, Richard Gilliland, died six months ago.“I would not be here without him” and his willingness to put her career first, said Smart. She also praised their two children as “courageous individuals in their own right.”Earlier in the evening, ebullient “Ted Lasso” castmate Hannah Waddingham, winner of the best supporting actress award for a comedy, said Sudeikis “changed my life with this, and more importantly my baby girl’s.”The show’s Brett Goldstein, who won the counterpart award for supporting actor, said he had promised not to swear and either mimed or was muted for a few seconds, then called the show the “privilege and pleasure” of his life.Gillian Anderson and Tobias Menzies of British royal drama “The Crown” were honored for their supporting performances.Anderson, who played British political leader Margaret Thatcher, used her acceptance speech to thank her manager of 20 years for her mentorship and believing in her talent before she did.Menzies who plays Prince Philip, didn’t attend the ceremony, which included a London gathering for “The Crown” nominees.Before announcing the winner in his category, presenter Kerry Washington saluted another nominee, Michael K. Williams of “Lovecraft County.” Williams died Sept. 6 at age 54.“Michael was a brilliantly talented actor and a generous human being who has left us far too soon,” Washington said.Another lost star was remembered by John Oliver of “Last Week Tonight with John Oliver.”“No one was funnier in the last 20 years than Norm Macdonald on late-night comedy,” Oliver said in accepting the Emmy for best variety talk show, suggesting people spend time checking out clips of Macdonald, as he did after Macdonald died Sept. 14 at age 61.Kate Winslet, who played the title character in “Mare of Easttown,” and Ewan McGregor, who starred in the fashion biopic “Halston,” were honored as top actors for a limited series.Winslet saluted her sister nominees in “this decade that has to be about women having each other’s back.”Julianne Nicholson and Evan Peters claimed best supporting acting honors for “Mare of Easttown,” about crime and family dysfunction.“The script was “true to the horror and beauty of ordinary people’s lives,” particularly the lives of women, said Nicholson.Both she and Peters saluted star Winslet.“Man, you’re good at acting. But turns out you’re good at caring for a whole production,” Nicholson said.Debbie Allen received the Governors Award for a long and acclaimed career as an actor, dancer, choreographer and activist“I am trembling with gratitude and grace and trying not to cry … it’s been many years in the making, taken a lot of courage to be the only woman in the room most of the time. Courage and creative and fight and faith to believe I could keep going, and I have,” she said.The show opened with a musical number that featured host Cedric the Entertainer rapping a modified version of the Biz Markie hip-hop hit “Just a Friend” with lyrics like “TV, you got what I need.” LL Cool J bounded from the audience as stars like Rita Wilson, Mandy Moore and more dropped verses celebrating the breadth of television.Seth Rogen presented the first award, throwing some cold water on the celebratory vibe by noting that the Emmys were being held in a giant tent. “There’s way too many of us in this little room,” he exclaimed in what seemed to be an attempt to be funny that fell flat.“Why is there a roof? It’s more important that we have three chandeliers than make sure we don’t kill Eugene Levy tonight. That is what has been decided.”Cedric the Entertainer worked hard and landed some laugh-getting jokes, but the night’s comedy bits were hit and miss — including Stephen Colbert’s jokes about California’s failed gubernatorial recall and Ken Jeong’s effort to get past security and into the show.Roughly 500 people attended the Emmys in downtown Los Angeles, with fashion standout Billy Porter sporting large wings attached to the sleeves of his black trouser look and Sudeikis walked the red carpet in a velvet suit of soft blue.The producers’ ultimate goal is a ceremony that is upbeat and acknowledges how much TV’s importance grew during the pandemic and its lockdowns.;8

Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd. reported earnings and revenue that missed Wall Street’s expectations, and the stock turned lower Thursday, despite the China-based e-commerce giant’s attempts to influence how its results were reported.The company reported net income attributable to ordinary shareholders that fell 41% to 8.69 billion renminbi (RMB), or RMB 3.30 a share, from RMB 14.68 billion, or RMB 5.65 a share, in the same period a year ago. The company said that, in U.S.-dollar terms, net income was the equivalent of $1.31 billion, with earnings per share of 50 cents.Alibaba provided “Non-GAAP diluted EPS,” which excludes nonrecurring items, and which reporters typically compare with analyst expectations, of RMB 8.04 — equivalent to $1.22 — up from RMB 7.95 a year ago.The stock BABA, -0.68% shot up as much as 4.9% soon after the open, before reversing course to close down 3.2%, with some news services having reported that Alibaba had beaten earnings expectations, even though typical earnings-reporting methods would suggest it did not.A representative of the company contacted MarketWatch on Thursday morning, explaining why EPS in renminbi terms, rather than in dollar terms, should be compared with analyst estimates.The spokesperson’s contention was that, since Alibaba and FactSet convert their respective numbers to U.S. dollars using exchange rates taken at different times, comparing the U.S. dollar equivalents would be like comparing apples and oranges. MarketWatch always compares company results with analyst consensus estimates compiled by FactSet. The Securities and Exchange Commission doesn’t provide a standard guide for earnings releases with regard to earnings in a home currency versus the U.S. dollar. Other companies that report in two currencies include Petrochina Co. Ltd. PTR, +0.04%, BP PLC BP, +4.31% and Brazil’s Petrobras PETR3, -0.56%. Ironically, the FactSet consensus for non-GAAP EPS in U.S. dollar terms was $1.21, meaning Alibaba would have beaten, but the EPS consensus in renminbi terms was 8.28, which means Alibaba missed expectations.Alibaba also contacted FactSet to make it aware of the exchange-rate discrepancies, a FactSet representative confirmed. In FactSet’s “surprise history” page, in which FactSet converts the results in an effort to compare apples to apples, the non-GAAP EPS reported by Alibaba was listed as $1.17, which missed the mean analyst estimate of $1.21.Some news sources reported that Alibaba beat earnings expectations — and it did, if you compare the net EPS numbers to analysts’ GAAP estimates; the FactSet GAAP EPS consensus was RMB 2.42, or 35 cents on a dollar basis. However, earnings reports rarely compare net EPS with analysts’ GAAP estimates when non-GAAP numbers are available, so it’s curious that some publications and news services chose to do so this time around.The reason non-GAAP numbers are usually compared with analyst estimates is that the majority of companies that provide guidance give non-GAAP guidance, so that’s what analysts have to work with to provide estimates.In 2017, of the 340 components of the S&P 500 that provided guidance, 277 provided non-GAAP guidance and 220 provided GAAP guidance, according to a report by Audit Analytics. Of those totals, 120 companies gave only non-GAAP guidance, while 63 companies gave only GAAP guidance, the report said.In Alibaba’s case, 24 analysts provided non-GAAP EPS estimates in renminbi, and 17 analysts provided GAAP EPS estimates.Don’t miss:SEC is once again ‘guiding’ companies on their use of non-GAAP numbersMeanwhile, Alibaba’s revenue, for which there is no non-GAAP number or comparison, grew 61% to RMB 80.92 billion — or $12.23 billion — and missed the FactSet renminbi consensus of 81.37 billion but beat the dollar estimate of $11.89 billion.See also:Study: Earnings surprises are bigger, thanks to growing use of non-GAAP metricsSome news sources reported that revenue in renminbi beat expectations, but that’s because they used different analyst estimate services that had lower consensus revenue numbers.Separately, Alibaba said it has established a local services company, housing the recently acquired online food-delivery company Ele.me and the local services platform business Koubei, to be capitalized separately with investments from Alibaba, Ant Financial and third-party investors.The company said that it received $3 billion in new investment commitments from Alibaba and Japan-based Softbank Group Corp. and that it will record a “material one-off revaluation gain” as it consolidates Koubei.Alibaba’s stock has tumbled 12.7% over the past three months, as concerns over a trade war between the U.S. and China and a slowing Chinese economy weighed on Chinese equities and the renminbi.In comparison, the iShares China Large-Cap exchange-traded fund FXI, -1.81% has dropped 11.1% over the past three months, while the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.06% has gained 4.7%.In a post-earnings conference call with analysts, Alibaba Executive Vice Chairman Joseph Tsai tried to dispel trade concerns by saying China has become less reliant on exports over the years, so that the Chinese economy can withstand the imposition of tariffs on Chinese products.Don’t miss: Here’s what businesses are saying about the Trump administration’s proposed tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goodsTsai said Alibaba is focused on capturing the Chinese domestic consumption opportunity, growing less reliant on exports. “We believe that Chinese government policy will continue to support imports into China to satisfy the rising demand of Chinese consumers,” Tsai said, according to a transcript provided by FactSet.";9
532;28/04/2020;BP earnings fall, but maintains quarterly dividend;BP earnings fall, but maintains quarterly dividend. BP PLC said Tuesday that earnings fell in the first quarter, reflecting a challenging commodity environment exacerbated by declining oil prices and weak demand.The London-based energy giant swung to a replacement cost loss--a metric similar to the net income figure that U.S. oil companies report--of $628 million for the three months ended March 31 from a profit of $2.10 billion for the year-earlier period.The figure includes a $1.4 billion net adverse impact of nonoperating items and fair value accounting effects, BP said.Stripping out one-off items, BP's underlying replacement cost profit, the company's preferred metric, fell to $800 million. A company-compiled consensus of 22 brokers' estimates had forecast the company's first-quarter underlying replacement cost profit at $710 million.Revenue for the quarter decreased to $59.54 billion from $67.41 billion the previous year, BP said.The company swung to a net loss of $4.37 billion from a profit of $2.93 billion.Upstream production fell 2.9% to 2.58 million barrels of oil equivalent a day. Underlying replacement-cost profit before interest and tax in the upstream business--which produces oil and gas--fell to $1.02 billion from $2.88 billion last year.BP said it expects second-quarter production to be lower and subject to uncertainties related to the implementation of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' restrictions, divestments and the coronavirus pandemic's impact on oil demand, among other factors.Operating cash flow, excluding payments related to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, was $1.23 billion, BP said.Net debt for the period was $51.4 billion compared with $45.1 billion a year earlier.Gearing--the ratio of net debt to the total of net debt and equity--was 36.2% from 30.4%. The gearing level is remains above the company's long-term target of between 20% and 30%.BP said it maintained its quarterly dividend at 10.25 cents a share.Write to Giulia Petroni at giulia.petroni@wsj.com;9
878;29/01/2021;Apple’s Sales Grow 21% in Latest Quarter, and Two More Numbers to Know;Apple’s Sales Grow 21% in Latest Quarter, and Two More Numbers to Know. Three numbers to start your day:The company sold shares into a blistering rally that sent its stock as much as 466% higher for the week, as of Wednesday’s closing high. But on Thursday some of the air came out of the bubble of widely shorted stocks, such as GameStop, Bed Bath & Beyond, and Express, as retail brokerages restricted trading. And it wasn’t clear how much the companies themselves had gained from the rally. AMC stock declined more than 50% on Thursday. And while the company was able to raise extra cash, it sold its stock at an average of $4.82 a share, well below Wednesday’s close near $20. That is according to data provider Ortex. Brigades of individual investors have been buying stocks that are unpopular on Wall Street, pushing prices higher. That has led to losses for the hedge funds who bet against these companies, in what is known as short selling. Earlier this week, Melvin Capital had to get a capital infusion from two of its peers. The losses show that while individual investors had a down day on Thursday, they are still winning for the month. GameStop is still up more than 900% so far in 2021, and AMC is up 300%. The tech giant’s quarterly earnings and sales easily beat Wall Street’s forecasts -- it posted $111 billion of quarterly revenue and earnings of $1.68 of a share. Analysts said its iPhone revenue was especially strong as consumer demand held up for newer and more expensive phones. But the stock declined Thursday, falling 3.5%, even though the broader market was up almost 1%. While that could have been because investors were distracted by the crazy trading in smaller stocks, it was more likely a matter of expectations. Apple itself has been on a tear over the past year, gaining 73% in 12 months. So analysts said that investors have gotten maybe a little too optimistic about the company’s business and were ready to take some profits. Numbers by Barron’s is our daily podcast.

296;27/10/2021;Apple Reports Earnings Today. Here’s What to Expect.;"Apple Reports Earnings Today. Here’s What to Expect.. The Street is getting a little worried about Apple. Not that anything terrible is likely to happen when Apple (ticker: AAPL) reports fiscal fourth-quarter financial results after the close of trading on Thursday. Street estimates call for revenue of $84.9 billion and earnings of 73 cents a share in the September quarter, and there is every reason to think the company will continue its recent pattern and blow away what are likely conservative analyst expectations. June quarter results beat Street revenue estimates by nearly $10 billion and earnings topped consensus by about 30%. But the stock is suffering from an assortment of nagging woes that likely won’t be resolved with this week’s earnings report. While it would hardly be shocking to see another strong quarter of iPhone sales, keep in mind that Apple CFO Luca Maestri three months ago warned that component issues were intensifying, with a potential impact in the quarter on iPhone and iPad sales. There have also been repeated recent reports of iPhone 13 shortages, reportedly tied to tight supplies of the camera modules used in the high-end versions of the new phone lineup.Apple has unveiled a flurry of new products recently, including updated iPhones, Macs, iPads and AirPods, and that should help bolster results for the December quarter. For that period, the Street consensus calls for revenue to jump to $119.7 billion with earnings of $1.41 a share. But since Apple seems unlikely to move off its Covid-era practice of not providing quarterly guidance, nervousness about the holiday quarter will remain.It’s telling that Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty, long one of the Street’s most influential bullish voices on the stock, is telling investors that this week’s earnings report isn’t likely to settle the current debate on Apple—and won’t likely serve as a catalyst for the stock.To be clear, Huberty expects results to again crush consensus estimates. She expects revenues of $88.2 billion, more than $3 billion above consensus, and she sees continued strength in iPhone, iPads, and Macs.Street consensus calls for September quarter iPhone revenue of $41.2 billion; revenue of $8.8 billion for iPads; $9.1 billion for Macs; $9.4 billion for wearables, home and accessories; and $17.7 billion for services.Huberty predicts that estimates will move higher on Thursday’s report, but she doesn’t think that will provide any lift to the stock. “Investors will be more focused on the December quarter outlook given September results only include a small portion of iPhone 13 shipments,” Huberty writes in a research note. “And while we are constructive on the December quarter outlook despite recent negative supply chain headlines, we don’t expect Apple to provide a formal revenue guidance range.”Huberty also notes that “a number of important questions” remain regarding both potential changes in the company’s App Store business model and the sustainability of iPhone growth given more difficult comparisons ahead. “With shares trading just 5% below Apple’s trailing 52-week high, we believe investors are more likely to wait for clarity on these topics before potentially re-engaging,” she writes. “So, while we remain bullish on Apple’s FY22 outlook and expect estimates to move higher post earnings, we just don’t see earnings alone as a material stock catalyst.”Apple shares on Wednesday were off 0.2% to $148.98.Write to Eric J.

435;15/01/2021;Citigroup beats profit estimates but revenue falls short;"Citigroup beats profit estimates but revenue falls short. Citigroup Inc. C, +0.63% said Friday it had net income of $4.6 billion, or $2.08 a share, in the fourth quarter, down from $5.0 billion, or $2.15 a share, in the year-earlier period. Revenue fell 10% to $16.5 billion from $18.4 billion. The FactSet consensus was for EPS of $1.34 and revenue of $16.7 billion. The revenue decline was due to lower revenues in global consumer banking, institutional clients group and corporate, the bank said in a statement. Net income fell due to lower revenue, higher costs and a higher tax rate, which was partly offset by lower cost of credit. Chief Executive Michael Corbat said full-year revenues were flat, despite the ""massive economic impact of COVID-19."" The bank had $676 billion in loans as of quarter end, down 3% from the year-earlier period. Deposits stood at $1.3 trillion, up 20%. Revenue from the global consumer banking business rose 11% to $4.7 billion. Revenue at the institutional clients group fell 1% to $9.3 billion, as treasury and trade solutions, investment banking and corporate banking revenue fell, offsetting strength in fixed income markets, equity markets and the private bank. Investment banking revenue fell 5% to $1.3 billion, as strong growth in equity underwriting was more than offset by lower revenue in M&A and debt underwriting. Equity underwriting revenue rose 83% to $438 million, while debt underwriting fell 16% to $617 million. Markets and securities revenues rose 13% to $4.5 billion, as fixed income markets revenue fell 7% to $3.1 billion and equity markets revenue rose 57% to $810 million. Corporate banking revenue were a negative $85 million, after positive $542 million a year ago. Citi shares fell 1.7% premarket, and have fallen 15% in the last 12 months, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.29% has gained 7%.";9
